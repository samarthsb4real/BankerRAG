#### PaperTrail allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX) for processing by the RAG model. After upload, documents undergo an approval process before being fully processed. The page will also track and display a timeline of all documents fed into the system.

### To-Do:

- Design file upload UI (drag-and-drop, file input).
- Handle file uploads via Next.js API routes.
- Show upload progress (spinner/bar).
- Provide success/failure feedback.
- Integrate document moderation and approval workflow.
- Create a timeline feature to track which documents have been uploaded and approved.
- Ensure backend integration for document processing post-approval.
- Test functionality and debug issues.
